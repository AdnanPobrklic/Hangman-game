Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Hangman, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
How to Play

    The game will choose a word at random, which the player will try to guess by suggesting letters.
    The player will input a letter into the text box and click the 'Guess' button to submit their guess.
    If the chosen letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word. If it is not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.
    The player will keep guessing letters until they either guess the word or the hangman is completely drawn.
    If the player correctly guesses the word before the hangman is drawn, they win the game. If the hangman is drawn before the player correctly guesses the word, they lose the game.
